            <p>
                My name is Arun Mahato, and I am excited to be part of this course. 
                I am majoring in Computer Science, as I have always been fascinated by the role technology plays in shaping the world around us.
                I enjoy solving challenging problems, working on programming projects, and staying updated with the latest trends in technology. 
                Outside of academics, I like exploring new hobbies, whether it is gaming, hiking, or experimenting with creative coding.
